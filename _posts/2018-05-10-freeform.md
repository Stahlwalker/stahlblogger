#### Using Formspree to connect with visitors:
Creating a contact form is as simple as 4 steps with Formspree. Included with these steps is an example code that can be plugged into any html file.   

1. Setup the html form
2. Add a name attribute to every field
3. Submit the form and confirm your email address
4. You are done and should be receiving email notifications. 

An example code will look something like this: 

```
<form action="https://formspree.io/your@email.com"
      method="POST">
    <input type="text" name="name">
    <input type="email" name="_replyto">
    <input type="submit" value="Send">
</form>
```

I've used Formspree on both [Stahlwalker's](https://www.stahlwalker.org) and on my [Interactive Resume](https://lucasstahl.com/). As a result, I receive an email notification anytime someone wants to connect. The good news it's free until you start receiving more than 1000 submissions a day, then you can upgrade for $10 a month.

Alternatives to Formspree are sites like Firebase, however Formspree is ultimately easier to use because it's a contact form generator, taking in the input you desire.
